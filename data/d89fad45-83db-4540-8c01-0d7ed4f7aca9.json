{"response": "\n\nI. Introduction\n\nTrade secrets are a vital part of a business's operations, allowing it to maintain its competitive edge in the market. In Delaware, the protection of trade secrets is governed by both common law and statutory law.\n\nThe Delaware Uniform Trade Secrets Act (DUTSA) is the primary statutory law governing trade secrets in the state. The DUTSA has adopted the Uniform Trade Secrets Act, which has been enacted by most of the states in the U.S. The DUTSA defines a trade secret as \"information, including a formula, pattern, compilation, program, device, method, technique, or process, that derives independent economic value, actual or potential, from not being generally known to, and not being readily ascertainable by proper means by, other persons who can obtain economic value from its disclosure or use, and is the subject of efforts that are reasonable under the circumstances to maintain its secrecy.\" Del. Code Ann. tit. 6, \u00a7 2001(4).\n\nDelaware courts have recognized that the protection of trade secrets is essential to a business's success, and have developed common law principles to protect trade secrets. In Fid. Bond & Mortgage Co. v. Gerber, the Delaware Supreme Court articulated that the four elements of a valid claim for misappropriation of trade secrets are as follows: \"(1) the existence of a trade secret; (2) communication of the trade secret to the defendant under an express or implied agreement limiting the use of such information; (3) use of the trade secret by the defendant in breach of that agreement; and (4) resulting damages.\" Fid. Bond & Mortgage Co. v. Gerber, 505 A.2d 806, 810 (Del. 1986). \n\nFurther, Delaware courts have also recognized that a trade secret may exist in a combination of elements, even if each individual element is not a trade secret on its own. In DuPont v. Kolon Industries, Inc., the court found that DuPont's process and formula for producing a synthetic fiber was a trade secret despite each individual element comprising the process and formula being publicly known. The court stated that \"even if the constituent components of a formula are generally known, the particular combination of components in a successful formula can still be a trade secret.\" E.I. du Pont de Nemours & Co. v. Kolon Indus., Inc., 803 F. Supp. 2d 471, 485 (D. Del. 2011).\n\nIn summary, the protection of trade secrets is essential to a business, and Delaware has both common law and statutory law to protect them. The Delaware Uniform Trade Secrets Act defines a trade secret and serves as a basis for protecting them. Delaware courts have recognized the importance of trade secrets in the success of businesses and have developed common law principles to protect them. \n\nA. Definition of Trade Secrets \n\nIn Delaware, the law of trade secrets is governed by the Delaware Uniform Trade Secrets Act (DUTSA), which defines trade secrets as \"information, including a formula, pattern, compilation, program, device, method, technique, or process, that: (i) derives independent economic value, actual or potential, from not being generally known to, and not being readily ascertainable by proper means by, other persons who can obtain economic value from its disclosure or use, and (ii) is the subject of efforts that are reasonable under the circumstances to maintain its secrecy\" (Del. Code Ann. tit. 6, \u00a7 2001(4)). \n\nThe DUTSA further provides that in determining whether information constitutes a trade secret, courts shall consider the following factors: \"(i) the extent to which the information is known outside of the owner\u2019s business; (ii) the extent to which it is known by employees and others involved in the owner\u2019s business; (iii) the extent of measures taken by the owner to protect the secrecy of the information; (iv) the value of the information to the owner and to competitors; (v) the amount of effort or money expended by the owner in developing the information; and (vi) the ease or difficulty with which the information could be properly acquired or duplicated by others\" (Del. Code Ann. tit. 6, \u00a7 2004). \n\nIn addition, case law provides further guidance on the definition of trade secrets in Delaware. In FMC Corp. v. Taiwan Tainan Giant Indus. Co., a Delaware federal court held that for information to qualify as a trade secret, it must be not only secret, but also valuable and legitimately protected (730 F. Supp. 1151, 1157 (D. Del. 1990)). In other words, the information must be something that the owner has taken reasonable measures to keep confidential and that has the potential to provide an economic advantage over competitors. \n\nOverall, the definition of trade secrets in Delaware is broad and includes a wide range of confidential information, as long as it meets the requirements set forth in the DUTSA and case law. The next sections of this explanation will delve further into the various aspects of Delaware law related to trade secrets, including the scope of protection afforded to trade secrets, the remedies available for trade secret misappropriation, and the requirements for bringing a claim for trade secret misappropriation. \n\nB. Overview of Delaware Law\n\nDelaware is one of the states that has adopted the Uniform Trade Secrets Act (UTSA), which provides a comprehensive framework for the protection of trade secrets. The Delaware Uniform Trade Secrets Act (DUTSA) is codified in Title 6, Chapter 20 of the Delaware Code, \u00a7\u00a7 2001 et seq. \n\nUnder DUTSA, a trade secret is defined as \u201cinformation, including a formula, pattern, compilation, program, device, method, technique, or process,\u201d that derives independent economic value from not being generally known or readily ascertainable by others and is subject to reasonable efforts to maintain its secrecy. \n\nDUTSA provides a cause of action for misappropriation of trade secrets, which occurs when a person \u201cacquires, uses, or discloses\u201d another person\u2019s trade secret through \u201cimproper means\u201d or when they use or disclose a trade secret that they knew or should have known was acquired through improper means. Improper means include theft, bribery, misrepresentation, breach of a duty to maintain secrecy, or espionage. \n\nOne particularly noteworthy aspect of DUTSA is that it contains a provision allowing for the award of attorneys\u2019 fees to the prevailing party in a lawsuit under certain circumstances. Specifically, \u00a7 2017 provides that if a claim of misappropriation is made in bad faith, a motion to terminate an injunction is made or resisted in bad faith, or willful and malicious misappropriation exists, the court may award reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees to the prevailing party. \n\nDelaware courts have consistently recognized the importance of protecting trade secrets in the state\u2019s economy. For example, in Chemical & Industrial Corp. v. Dravo Corp., 341 A.2d 708, 713 (Del. Ch. 1975), the Delaware Chancery Court held that the public policy of Delaware favors the protection of trade secrets and that the common law protects against the disclosure of trade secrets by employees. \n\nOverall, Delaware law provides a robust legal framework for the protection of trade secrets, including a clear definition of what constitutes a trade secret, available remedies for misappropriation, and potential recovery of attorneys\u2019 fees for bad faith or willful misappropriation. \n\nSources: \n\nDelaware Uniform Trade Secrets Act, 6 Del. Code \u00a7\u00a7 2001 et seq. \n\nChemical & Industrial Corp. v. Dravo Corp., 341 A.2d 708, 713 (Del. Ch. 1975). \n\nScope of Trade Secrets Protection in Delaware \n\nThe law of trade secrets in Delaware broadly defines trade secrets and extends protection to confidential information that is valuable to its owner and kept confidential from competitors. This protection prevents unauthorized use or disclosure of the trade secret by others. \n\nDelaware courts have established that a trade secret is any information, process, formula or method that provides competitive advantage to the owner and that is not known or readily ascertainable to others who could benefit from its use. This definition is consistent with the Uniform Trade Secrets Act (UTSA) which Delaware has adopted.  \n\n\n\nDelaware Code, Title 6, Chapter 20, \u00a7 2001-2006, the Delaware's version of the UTSA, serves as the primary statute governing trade secrets in the state. Delaware courts have relied on the UTSA provisions to determine the scope of protection one can claim for a trade secret. The statute defines trade secrets as information that derives independent economic value from not being generally known or readily ascertainable to others who could obtain economic value from its use, and is subject to reasonable efforts under the circumstances to maintain its secrecy. \n\nThe Restatement of Torts, Second, section 757 defines trade secrets as \"any formula, pattern, device or compilation of information which is used in one's business and which gives him an opportunity to obtain an advantage over competitors who do not know or use it.\" \n\n\n\nIn DuPont v. Kolon Industries, Inc., 803 F.Supp.2d 515 (D. Del. 2011), aff'd, 748 F.3d 1195 (Fed. Cir. 2014), the court held that trade secret protection extends not just to the precise recipe or process but also to the underlying technology or know-how that enables the recipe or process to be created or practiced. In that case, DuPont had shared information about its Kevlar technology with a potential competitor under a nondisclosure agreement. That competitor, Kolon Industries, then allegedly used the information to make its own para-aramid fibers, which DuPont claimed violated its trade secrets. The Court ruled in DuPont's favor, finding that the technology underlying the Kevlar process was also protectable trade secrets. \n\nIn a recent case involving a healthcare company, Fidelity National Information Services, Inc. v. FICO, 346 F. Supp. 3d 587, 593 (D. Del. 2018), the court held that an employer who takes reasonable steps to keep confidential information secret may have a common law claim for breach of confidential relationship if an employee discloses confidential information to a competitor. \n\nIn conclusion, Delaware law offers broad protection for trade secrets, extending beyond the scope of specific formulas or processes. The legal landscape surrounding the protection and enforcement of trade secrets in Delaware is constantly evolving, and businesses wishing to protect their trade secrets should work closely with experienced attorneys to safeguard their interests. \n\nReferences:\n\nDelaware Code, Title 6, Chapter 20, \u00a7 2001-2006.\n\nUniform Trade Secrets Act.\n\nDuPont v.

FICO, 346 F. Supp. 3d 587, 593 (D. Del. 2018). \n\nII. Elements of a Trade Secret\n\nTo qualify as a trade secret, information must meet the following criteria: \n\nA. Information\n\nThe subject matter of a trade secret must be \"information.\" Delaware Uniform Trade Secrets Act (DUTSA) defines \"information\" broadly as \"any scientific, technical, or business information, including financial information, designs, drawings, engineering plans, procurement requirements, or lists of actual or potential suppliers or customers.\" 6 Del. C. \u00a7 2001(4). The information may be conveyed in any form, including in writing, verbally, or electronically.\n\nB. Derives Independent Economic Value\n\nThe information must derive independent economic value from not being generally known to the public or other persons who can obtain economic value from its disclosure or use. 6 Del. C. \u00a7 2001(2). In other words, the information must have value because it is not generally known.\n\nC. Efforts to Maintain Secrecy\n\nThe owner must take reasonable efforts to maintain the secrecy of the information. This requirement is closely tied to the information's actual or potential value. Courts consider a variety of factors in evaluating whether the owner has taken reasonable steps to maintain secrecy, including the following:\n\n1. The extent to which the information is known outside of the owner's business;\n2. The measures taken by the owner to guard the secrecy of the information;\n3. The value of the information to the owner and to competitors;\n4. The amount of money or effort expended by the owner in developing the information;\n5. The ease or difficulty with which the information could be properly acquired or duplicated by others.\n\nDelaware courts have emphasized that \"reasonable measures\" to maintain secrecy need not be \"unbreakable.\" ILC Dover, LP v. United States, 682 F. Supp. 2d 695, 703 (D. Del. 2010) (citation omitted). Rather, courts consider all the relevant circumstances, including the nature of the information and the owner's particular circumstances, in determining whether the owner has taken reasonable steps. See, e.g., Platinum Management (CA), LLC v. Dahne, 2015 WL 6642647, at *8 (Del. Ch. Oct. 22, 2015) (discussing the variety of reasonable measures owners may take to maintain secrecy).\n\nD. Not Generally Known\n\nThe information must not be generally known or readily ascertainable through proper means. 6 Del. C. \u00a7 2001(2). \"Proper means\" refers to means that are generally used in a particular industry or field to obtain information, such as reverse engineering or analysis of publicly available data. See, e.g., DuPont v. Kolon Industries, Inc., 801 F. Supp. 2d 620, 670 (E.D. Va. 2011).\n\nE. Statute of Limitations\n\nAny cause of action for misappropriation of a trade secret must be brought within three years after the misappropriation is discovered or should have been discovered by the exercise of reasonable diligence. 6 Del. C. \u00a7 2004.\n\nOverall, determining whether information qualifies as a trade secret requires a fact-intensive analysis. If you believe your information may qualify as a trade secret, it is important to consult with an experienced attorney to discuss your rights and the steps you can take to protect your information. \n\nA. Must have Economic Value\n\nOne of the fundamental requirements for information to be protected as a trade secret under Delaware law is that it must have economic value. As defined in the Delaware Uniform Trade Secrets Act (DUTSA), a trade secret is information that (1) derives independent economic value, actual or potential, from not being generally known to, and not being readily ascertainable by proper means by, other persons who can obtain economic value from its disclosure or use, and (2) is the subject of efforts that are reasonable under the circumstances to maintain its secrecy. 6 Del. C. \u00a7 2001(4).\n\nThe phrase \"economic value\" is not defined in the statute, but it has been interpreted broadly by Delaware courts. In FGS Insurance Agency, Inc. v. O'Connell, the Delaware Supreme Court held that information may have economic value based on a variety of factors, including its usefulness to the owner in the owner's business, its usefulness to competitors, and the difficulty of obtaining the information through lawful means. 991 A.2d 242, 249 (Del. 2010). The court also noted that \"infusing confidential information with economic value is the very purpose of a trade secret.\" Id.\n\nTo satisfy the economic value requirement under DUTSA, the information must not be generally known to others who could obtain economic value from its disclosure or use. This means that the information must be both confidential and valuable. As explained in E.I. du Pont de Nemours & Co. v. Christopher, \"[a]lthough the cloak of confidentiality alone does not create an interest in nondisclosure[,] a significant level of economic value of the kind that can be relied upon in the marketplace can result from the force of keeping the data confidential.\" 431 A.2d 1012, 1019 (Del. Ch. 1981). Moreover, the fact that the information may be difficult to obtain lawfully can also contribute to its economic value. See O'Connell, 991 A.2d at 249.\n\nIn sum, for information to be protected as a trade secret under Delaware law, it must have economic value based on its usefulness to the owner's business, its usefulness to competitors, and/or the difficulty of obtaining it lawfully. The information must also be kept confidential and be the subject of reasonable efforts to maintain its secrecy. See 6 Del. C. \u00a7 2001(4); O'Connell, 991 A.2d at 249; Christopher, 431 A.2d at 1019. \n\nB. Must be the Subject of Efforts to Maintain Secrecy\n\nThe second element that a trade secret must have in order to be protected under Delaware law is that it must be the subject of efforts to maintain secrecy. This means that the owner of the trade secret must take active steps to protect the confidentiality of the information.\n\nDelaware Code section 6-2002(4) defines a trade secret, in part, as \"information, including a formula, pattern, compilation, program, device, method, technique, or process...\" that has \"independent economic value\" and that \"is the subject of efforts that are reasonable under the circumstances to maintain its secrecy.\"\n\nThe \"reasonable efforts\" requirement has been interpreted by Delaware courts to mean that the owner of the trade secret must take some affirmative action to protect the information. In Diodes, Inc. v. Franzen, 260 A.2d 244, 248 (Del. Ch. 1969), the court stated that \"[i]n order to be entitled to protection, a trade secret must be the subject of reasonable efforts to keep the information secret.\" Similarly, in Univ. of Notre Dame du Lac v. Twentieth Century Fox Film Corp., 22 F. Supp. 2d 878, 887 (N.D. Ind. 1998), the court held that \"trade secret protection extends only to those measures necessary to guard against improper disclosures, and only when reasonable efforts are employed to maintain the secrecy of the information.\"\n\nThe exact measures that are required to maintain the secrecy of a trade secret will vary depending on the circumstances of the case. However, some typical steps that a trade secret owner may take include:\n\n- Requiring employees and contractors who have access to the information to sign nondisclosure agreements or other confidentiality agreements.\n- Limiting access to the information to only those individuals who have a need to know.\n- Marking documents or computer files containing the information as \"confidential\" or \"proprietary.\"\n- Implementing physical security measures, such as securing the information in a locked room or cabinet.\n- Limiting the dissemination of the information to a need-to-know basis.\n- Maintaining records of who has access to the information and when.\n\nIn short, the owner of a trade secret must take proactive steps to limit the availability of the information and to prevent its unauthorized disclosure. Failure to take appropriate steps to maintain the secrecy of a trade secret may result in the loss of trade secret protection.\n\nIn summary, in Delaware, a trade secret must have both economic value and be the subject of efforts that are reasonable under the circumstances to maintain its secrecy to be protected. This two-pronged approach ensures that only true trade secrets, as opposed to general skills or knowledge, are protected by the law. \n\nSection III: Elements of Trade Secret Misappropriation\n\nIn Delaware, trade secret misappropriation occurs when a person:\n\na. Acquires a trade secret of another by improper means;\nb. Discloses or uses a trade secret of another without express or implied consent by the owner; or\nc. Discloses or uses a trade secret of another with knowledge that the disclosure or use will result in a loss or harm to the owner. \n\nThe owner of the trade secret has the burden to establish both the existence of a trade secret and the misappropriation of the trade secret. To establish the existence of a trade secret, the owner must demonstrate that the information is:\n\na. Secret;\nb. Has commercial value;\nc. Was subject to reasonable efforts to maintain its secrecy.\n\nCourts generally recognize that not all business information is a trade secret. Informal marketing data, such as general customer preferences, are considered categories of information that are not trade secrets. \n\nThe Delaware trade secrets statute recognizes the Uniform Trade Secrets Act (\u201cUTSA\u201d) and defines trade secrets as information including, but not limited to, a formula, pattern, compilation, program, device, method, technique, or process; that:\n\na. Derives independent economic value, actual or potential, from not being generally known to, and not being readily ascertainable by proper means by, other persons who can obtain economic value from its disclosure or use; and\nb. Is the subject of efforts that are reasonable under the circumstances to maintain its secrecy.\n\nDelaware courts consistently apply the UTSA in trade secret cases, unless conflicting Delaware common law principles apply. In Diamond State Tire, Inc. v. Diamond Tire Pro & Auto Care, the court found that customer lists and pricing information could constitute trade secrets, if it was not generally known and if adequate steps had been taken to protect the confidential information. \n\nIt is important to note that even if a person acquires a trade secret through lawful means, if that person then uses the trade secret in an unauthorized manner, such use constitutes trade secret misappropriation.\n\nCase law also suggests that misappropriation of a trade secret requires more than mere use or disclosure of information that qualifies as a trade secret. In Bimbo Bakeries USA, Inc. v. Botticella, the court held that providing an employee with a trade secret in confidence, and then subsequent to termination of employment, that employee\u2019s use of the trade secret did not constitute misappropriation. \n\nHowever, misappropriation may be found when a person uses a trade secret without authorization, even if he or she did not know that the information was a trade secret. For example, in Freudenberg-NOK General Partnership v. Am. Seal & Eng'g Co., the court held that a former employee\u2019s invention, which used the trade secret technology he learned from his prior employer, constituted misappropriation because he used his former employer\u2019s trade secret in his later invention. \n\nOverall, the elements of trade secret misappropriation in Delaware require the owner of the trade secret to establish the existence of a trade secret and the improper acquisition, use, or disclosure of that trade secret by another person. \n\nSources:\n\n10 Del. C. \u00a7 8144(a)-(c) (2021).\nDiamond State Tire, Inc. v. Diamond Tire Pro & Auto Care, LLC, 2020 Del. Super. LEXIS 486 (Del. Super. Ct. June 2, 2020).\nBimbo Bakeries USA, Inc. v.

Protection of Trade Secrets in Delaware\n\nThe Delaware Uniform Trade Secrets Act (\"DUTSA\") was enacted in 1984 and provides the framework for the protection of trade secrets in Delaware. DUTSA is modeled after the Uniform Trade Secrets Act and has been adopted by the majority of states in the United States.\n\nUnder DUTSA, a trade secret is defined as information, including a formula, pattern, compilation, program, device, method, technique, or process that: (1) derives independent economic value, actual or potential, from not being generally known to the public or to other persons who can obtain economic value from its disclosure or use; and (2) is the subject of efforts that are reasonable under the circumstances to maintain its secrecy. Del. Code Ann. tit. 6, \u00a7 2002(4).\n\nTo assert a claim for misappropriation of trade secrets under DUTSA, a plaintiff must prove the following elements:\n\n(1) the existence of a trade secret;\n\n(2) that the trade secret was disclosed through improper means or used by the defendant without the consent of the plaintiff; and\n\n(3) that the defendant's disclosure or use of the trade secret resulted in damages to the plaintiff.\n\nDel. Code Ann. tit. 6, \u00a7 2004.\n\nDUTSA provides both injunctive and monetary relief for the misappropriation of trade secrets. A court may issue an injunction to prevent actual or threatened misappropriation and may award damages for actual loss caused by the misappropriation and any unjust enrichment caused by the misappropriation. Del. Code Ann. tit. 6, \u00a7 2005.\n\nIn addition to DUTSA, Delaware recognizes the common law tort of misappropriation of trade secrets. To establish a claim for common law misappropriation of trade secrets, a plaintiff must show that:\n\n(1) the plaintiff possesses a trade secret;\n\n(2) the defendant has acquired, disclosed or used the trade secret without the plaintiff's consent, and\n\n(3) the defendant's actions have resulted in damages to the plaintiff.\n\nAlbert v. Alex. Brown Mgmt. Servs., Inc., 870 A.2d 19, 50 (Del. Ch. 2005).\n\nUnder the common law, a trade secret may be protected through a variety of means, including contracts and restrictive covenants. Courts in Delaware have held that non-compete agreements, non-solicitation agreements, and confidentiality agreements may be enforced to protect trade secrets. See, e.g., E.I. du Pont de Nemours & Co. v. Pressman, 679 A.2d 436, 444 (Del. 1996) (holding that a restrictive covenant may be enforced if it is reasonable in scope and duration).\n\nIn sum, Delaware law provides strong protection for trade secrets through both DUTSA and common law. To protect against the misappropriation of trade secrets, businesses should take reasonable steps to maintain the secrecy of their confidential information and use agreements, such as non-compete and confidentiality agreements, to further safeguard against disclosure and use by competitors or former employees. \n\nA. Common Law\n\nThe law of trade secrets in Delaware is based on common law principles. Common law refers to the body of law based on court decisions, rather than statutes or regulations. \n\nIn Delaware, the common law definition of a trade secret is essentially the same as the definition in the Uniform Trade Secrets Act (UTSA) which Delaware has adopted. According to the Delaware Supreme Court, a trade secret is \u201cany formula, pattern, device, or compilation of information which is used in one\u2019s business, and which gives him an opportunity to obtain an advantage over competitors who do not know or use it.\u201d CMI Int\u2019l v. Intercargo Ins. Co., 81 A.3d 291, 309 (Del. 2013) (quoting Restatement (First) of Torts \u00a7 757). \n\nUnder Delaware\u2019s common law, a trade secret owner has the right to seek damages for misappropriation of their trade secret. Misappropriation can take many forms, including theft, breach of a confidentiality agreement, or violation of an employee\u2019s duty of loyalty to their employer. See CMI Int\u2019l, 81 A.3d at 309. \n\nIn deciding whether information qualifies as a trade secret, Delaware courts consider several factors, including the extent to which the information is known outside of the owner\u2019s business, the measures taken by the owner to protect the secrecy of the information, the value of the information to the owner and their competitors, and the effort and money expended by the owner in developing the information. See CMI Int\u2019l, 81 A.3d at 309; see also Restatement (First) of Torts \u00a7 757 comment b. \n\nOne key aspect of Delaware\u2019s common law is the requirement that the trade secret holder take reasonable measures to protect the secrecy of the information. CMI Int\u2019l, 81 A.3d at 310. If a trade secret holder fails to take reasonable measures to protect their information, they may be barred from seeking relief for misappropriation. See id. \n\nFor example, in CMI Int\u2019l, a company claimed that a former employee had misappropriated its trade secrets by using customer lists and other proprietary information gained through his employment to solicit customers on behalf of a new employer. See id. at 295-96. The court found that CMI had taken reasonable steps to protect the secrecy of its information, by requiring employees to sign non-disclosure agreements, limiting access to confidential information, and instructing employees not to disclose confidential information. See id. at 310. Therefore, CMI was entitled to relief for the former employee\u2019s misappropriation of its trade secrets. See id. at 311. \n\nDelaware\u2019s common law also recognizes the doctrine of inevitable disclosure. This doctrine allows a court to enjoin an employee from working for a competitor if the employee\u2019s new position would inevitably lead to the use of the former employer\u2019s trade secrets. See Agilent Techs., Inc. v. Kirkland, 2006 WL 2384847, at *3 (Del. Ch. Aug. 16, 2006). \n\nIn conclusion, Delaware\u2019s common law provides robust protection for trade secrets, based on principles that have been developed and refined over many years. Understanding these principles is essential for any business seeking to protect its valuable intellectual property in Delaware. \n\nCitations: \n\n- CMI Int\u2019l v. Intercargo Ins. Co., 81 A.3d 291, 309 (Del. 2013) \n- Restatement (First) of Torts \u00a7 757 \n- Agilent Techs., Inc. v. Kirkland, 2006 WL 2384847, at *3 (Del. Ch. Aug. 16, 2006). \n\n\nB. Statutory Law\n\nTrade secret law in Delaware is governed by both common law and statutory regulations. The main statutory authority governing trade secret law in Delaware is the Delaware Uniform Trade Secrets Act (DUTSA) (Del. Code Ann. tit. 6, \u00a7\u00a7 2001\u20132009).\n\nThe DUTSA provides a statutory definition of trade secrets, which is similar to the definition provided under the Uniform Trade Secrets Act (UTSA) adopted in most states in the United States. The DUTSA defines a trade secret as information, including a formula, pattern, compilation, program, device, method, technique or process that:\n\n(i) derives independent economic value, actual or potential, from not being generally known to, and not being readily ascertainable by proper means by, other persons who can obtain economic value from its disclosure or use, and\n\n(ii) is the subject of efforts that are reasonable under the circumstances to maintain its secrecy.\n\nDel. Code Ann. tit. 6, \u00a7 2001(4).\n\nThe DUTSA imposes civil liability on any person who misappropriates a trade secret. Misappropriation is defined under the DUTSA as the acquisition, disclosure or use of a trade secret of another without express or implied consent or by theft, bribery, or breach or inducement of a breach of duty to maintain secrecy. Del. Code Ann. tit. 6, \u00a7 2001(2).\n\nThe DUTSA provides for injunctive relief and damages for any person injured by a violation of the act. Injunctive relief may be granted to prevent actual or threatened misappropriation, and damages may include both actual loss caused by the misappropriation and unjust enrichment caused by the misappropriation. Del. Code Ann. tit. 6, \u00a7 2004.\n\nWhile the DUTSA provides a statutory framework for trade secret protection in Delaware, courts in Delaware may also look to common law principles for guidance. In Practice Management Information Corp. v. American Medical Assoc., the Delaware Supreme Court acknowledged that the DUTSA does not replace the common law of trade secrets, but rather supplements it. 121 A.3d 438, 454 (Del. 2015).\n\nOverall, the DUTSA establishes a comprehensive framework for the protection of trade secrets in Delaware, and is an important tool for businesses in Delaware that seek to protect proprietary and confidential information from misappropriation by competitors or third parties. \n\nEnforcement of Trade Secrets\n\nOnce a trade secret is misappropriated, the owner may seek relief through Delaware courts. Delaware has adopted the Uniform Trade Secrets Act (UTSA), which provides a civil cause of action for misappropriation of trade secrets. Section 2087 of Title 6 of the Delaware Code defines the misappropriation of a trade secret as:\n\n\"[a]cquisition of a trade secret of another by a person who knows or has reason to know that the trade secret was acquired by improper means; [d]isclosure or use of a trade secret of another without express or implied consent by a person who used improper means to acquire knowledge of the trade secret; [d]isclosure or use of a trade secret of another without express or implied consent by a person who at the time of disclosure or use knew or had reason to know that his knowledge of the trade secret was derived from or through a person who had utilized improper means to acquire it; or [d]isclosure or use of a trade secret of another without express or implied consent by a person who knew or had reason to know that it was acquired by accident or mistake.\"\n\nAny person who misappropriates a trade secret is liable for the damages caused by the misappropriation. Proof of actual damages is not required if the misappropriation is willful and malicious, in which case the court may award exemplary damages of up to twice the amount of actual damages. 6 Del. C. \u00a7 2088.\n\nIn addition to damages, the court may enjoin the misappropriation of the trade secret. The UTSA provides for a preliminary injunction to prevent actual or threatened misappropriation, upon a showing of likelihood of success on the merits, irreparable injury, and a balance of hardships in favor of the plaintiff. 6 Del. C. \u00a7 2089.\n\nMoreover, under Delaware common law, an employer may enforce a non-compete agreement to protect its trade secrets. In determining the enforceability of a non-compete agreement, the Delaware courts will balance the employer's interest in protecting its trade secrets against the employee's right to work. Precisionaire, Inc. v. Eastern Airlines, Inc., 181 A.2d 345, 348 (Del. Super. 1962). The court will consider factors such as the reasonableness of the geographic scope and duration of the non-compete agreement as well as the nature of the employment relationship. See also Donahue v. Rodd Electrotype Co. of New England, 367 A.2d 481, 484 (Del. Super. Ct. 1976) (requiring that the scope of the non-compete be no greater than necessary to protect the employer's legitimate interests); Sterling Drug, Inc. v. Oxford, 294 A.2d 899, 904 (Del. Ch. 1971) (holding that a non-compete agreement is enforceable if it is reasonable in scope and necessary to protect the employer's business interests). \n\nIV. Common Law Protections\n\nIn Delaware, common law provides additional protection to trade secrets beyond statutory law. The Delaware Supreme Court has recognized the existence of a \u201ccommon law right to maintain the confidentiality of trade secrets.\u201d Dubroff v. W.W. Norton & Co., 383 A.2d 533, 537 (Del. 1978). This common law right \u201capplies to trade secrets that do not fall within the statutory definition, such as business information that is not necessarily technical or scientific in nature.\u201d Alliance Logistic Solutions, LLC v. Ameriquest Transp. Servs., Inc., 2018 WL 361657, at *6 (Del. Super. Ct. Jan. 10, 2018) (citing Dubroff, 383 A.2d at 537).\n\nUnder the common law, a trade secret is any confidential business information that provides a company with an economic advantage over its competitors. DuPont v. Kolon Indus., Inc., 801 F. Supp. 2d 470, 476 (D. Del. 2011) (citing Restatement (First) of Torts \u00a7 757). To qualify for protection as a trade secret, this information must be kept secret and must not be generally known outside of the company. Id. (citing AAMCO Transmissions, Inc. v. Tayloe, 449 A.2d 1103, 1107 (Del. Ch. 1982)).\n\nThe Delaware courts have applied a three-part test to determine whether information qualifies as a trade secret under the common law. The information must:\n\n1. Derive independent economic value, actual or potential, from not being generally known to, and not being readily ascertainable by proper means by, other persons who can obtain economic value from its disclosure or use;\n2. Be the subject of efforts that are reasonable under the circumstances to maintain its secrecy; and\n3. Be of a nature such that one who possesses it or has obtained it is subject to a duty to maintain its secrecy.\n\nA to Z Elec. Servs. Corp. v. RSM Equipt. Rental, Inc., 2014 WL 1330472, at *4 (Del. Ch. Apr. 1, 2014) (quoting Restatement (First) of Torts \u00a7 757 cmt. b).\n\nCourts have also recognized that trade secrets need not be in written form to be protected. Rather, they can be \u201cembodied in a product,\u201d such as a unique manufacturing process. B.K. Instrument, Inc. v. Surgident Co., 646 F. Supp. 1349, 1353 (D. Del. 1986) (citing Restatement (First) of Torts \u00a7 757 cmt. b).\n\nIn addition, the common law provides for remedies for trade secret misappropriation, including injunctive relief and damages. Dubroff, 383 A.2d at 537-38. Courts have also recognized that trade secret misappropriation can occur even if the misappropriator did not intend to do so. Intel Corp. v. Hamidi, 732 A.2d 469, 484 (Del. 1999) (citing PPG Indus., Inc. v. Webster Auto. Parts Co., 128 A.2d 65, 69 (Del. Ch. 1956)).\n\nOverall, the common law protections for trade secrets in Delaware provide an additional layer of protection for companies seeking to maintain the confidentiality of their business information beyond the protections afforded by statutory law. \n\nA. Misappropriation\n\nMisappropriation is a fundamental element of a trade secret claim. It refers to the acquisition, use, or disclosure of another\u2019s trade secret without the owner\u2019s authorization or consent. In Delaware, the Uniform Trade Secrets Act (UTSA) defines misappropriation as (a) acquisition of a trade secret through \u201cimproper means,\u201d or (b) disclosure or use of a trade secret by a person who received the information under an express or implied duty of confidentiality. 6 Del. C. \u00a7 2001(2).\n\nThe UTSA further defines \u201cimproper means\u201d as including theft, bribery, misrepresentation, breach or inducement of a breach of a duty to maintain secrecy, or espionage through electronic or other means. 6 Del. C. \u00a7 2001(1).\n\nA person who acquires a trade secret through independent development or reverse engineering does not violate the misappropriation provision. 6 Del. C. \u00a7 2001(2)(A).\n\nThe Delaware Supreme Court has applied the UTSA\u2019s definition of misappropriation in several cases. In FMC Corp. v. Taiwan Tainan Giant Indus. Co., Ltd., the court held that misappropriation requires a showing that the information is a trade secret and that the defendant gained access through improper means. 730 A.2d 953, 961 (Del. 1999).\n\nIn DuPont Nutrition Biosciences APS v. Chris Hansen, the Court of Chancery ruled that misappropriation occurred when a former employee, who had access to the plaintiff\u2019s confidential information, formed a new company that competed with the plaintiff using similar technology. 124 A.3d 876, 896 (Del. Ch. 2015).\n\nIn sum, misappropriation is a critical element of a trade secret claim in Delaware, and the UTSA\u2019s definition of misappropriation controls the analysis. A plaintiff must demonstrate that the defendant acquired or used the trade secret through improper means or breached a duty of confidentiality. The Delaware courts have applied this definition in recent cases involving trade secret misappropriation. \n\nB. Breach of Confidence\n\nOne of the core principles underpinning the law of trade secrets is the concept of confidentiality. As the Delaware Supreme Court explained in Hanson v. Inpact International, Inc., \"Trade secrets are, by definition, secret. Their value inheres in the fact that they are not known to the public, and they lose their value as trade secrets when they become public knowledge.\" 525 A.2d 1206, 1210 (Del. 1987). If a person or entity violates confidentiality by divulging or improperly using trade secrets, this can give rise to a claim for breach of confidence.\n\nUnder Delaware law, the elements of a claim for breach of confidence require a plaintiff to show (1) the existence of a confidential relationship, (2) disclosure of confidential information, and (3) unauthorized use of that information. See Greyhound Corp. v. Bee Line, Inc., 496 A.2d 766, 772 (Del. Ch. 1985) (citing Guth v. Loft, Inc., 5 A.2d 503, 510 (Del. 1939)).\n\nTo establish a confidential relationship, the plaintiff must demonstrate that the information was given or obtained in circumstances that created an obligation of confidentiality. This can arise from an express agreement, such as a nondisclosure agreement, or be implied from the circumstances surrounding the disclosure. See Greyhound Corp., 496 A.2d at 772-73. For example, if an employer discloses confidential information to an employee for the purpose of carrying out employment duties, there may be an implied obligation of confidentiality.\n\nThe disclosure element requires the plaintiff to show that the defendant actually received or was privy to the confidential information. See Hanson, 525 A.2d at 1210. This can be shown through direct evidence, such as witness testimony or documents, or through circumstantial evidence, such as the defendant's subsequent use of the information.\n\nThe final element of unauthorized use is often the most difficult to prove. As the Delaware Supreme Court noted in Access Point Technologies, Inc. v. Learning Curve Int'l, Inc., \"In order to prevail on a claim of misappropriation, a plaintiff must prove that the defendant made use of the plaintiff's trade secret in such a manner as to derive some benefit from it.\" 678 A.2d 873, 877 (Del. 1996). The benefit need not be financial gain, and can include obtaining a competitive advantage or causing harm to the plaintiff. See id.\n\nIf a plaintiff can establish all three elements of a claim for breach of confidence, they may be entitled to damages for any harm suffered as a result of the disclosure or unauthorized use of the trade secret. This can include lost profits, diminution in value, or other consequential damages. See Hanson, 525 A.2d at 1212.\n\nIn addition to damages, a plaintiff may also seek injunctive relief to prevent further disclosure or use of the trade secret. Delaware courts have recognized that \"an award of damages alone might not be sufficient to make the plaintiff whole because the plaintiff's trade secrets, once disclosed, can be difficult, if not impossible to recapture.\" SCS Healthcare Marketing, LLC v. Allergan, Inc., 2019 WL 1006311, at *27 (Del. Ch. Mar. 1, 2019) (citing Hanson, 525 A.2d at 1212-13).\n\nOverall, breach of confidence is a critical facet of the law of trade secrets, as it protects the confidential nature of valuable information that forms the backbone of many businesses. By establishing clear requirements for proving breach of confidence claims, Delaware law offers a robust legal framework for safeguarding these assets. \n\nSection III: Requirements for Protection\n\nUnder Delaware law, for information to qualify as a trade secret, it must meet certain requirements. First, the information must derive independent economic value from not being generally known or readily ascertainable by others who could use it for commercial gain. (Del. Code Ann. tit. 6, \u00a7 2001(4)(b); see also DuPont Powder Co. v. Masland, 244 A.2d 797, 798 (Del. Ch. 1968) (holding that the trade secret must be something that is not generally known and readily ascertainable by proper means)). This requirement ensures that the information is truly valuable and not simply something that is readily available.\n\nSecond, the information must be the subject of reasonable efforts to maintain its secrecy. (Del. Code Ann. tit. 6, \u00a7 2001(4)(b); see also Unisource Worldwide, Inc. v. Valenti, 2016 WL 8725651, at *8 (Del. Super. Ct. Oct. 7, 2016) (finding that the plaintiff had taken reasonable steps to maintain secrecy because it had required all employees with access to the trade secrets to sign confidentiality agreements)). Reasonable efforts may include, for example, signing confidentiality agreements, using passwords and encryption, and limiting access to the information on a need-to-know basis.\n\nThird, the information must not be generally known in the relevant industry or geographic area. (Del. Code Ann. tit. 6, \u00a7 2001(4)(b); see also Lilly Indus., Inc. v. Franchi, 3 A.3d 722, 727 (Del. Ch. 2010) (finding that the information was a trade secret because it had not been disclosed to the public and had been kept confidential within the company)). If the information has been disclosed to others in the industry, it may not qualify as a trade secret.\n\nFourth, the information must not be easily discoverable by reverse engineering or other means. (Del. Code Ann. tit. 6, \u00a7 2001(4)(b); see also S. Jersey Welding Supply, Inc. v. Permasteelisa N. Am., Corp., 2017 WL 1908904, at *4 (Del. Super. Ct. May 10, 2017) (finding that the information was a trade secret because it could not be easily reverse engineered)). This requirement ensures that the information is truly secret and not simply something that can be easily figured out.\n\nOverall, the requirements for protection of trade secrets under Delaware law are designed to ensure that the information is truly valuable, is kept secret, and is not easily discoverable by others. Failure to meet any of these requirements may result in the loss of trade secret protection.\n\nSources:\n\nDel. Code Ann. tit. 6, \u00a7 2001(4)(b)\n\nDuPont Powder Co. v. Masland, 244 A.2d 797, 798 (Del. Ch. 1968)\n\nUnisource Worldwide, Inc. v. Valenti, 2016 WL 8725651, at *8 (Del. Super. Ct. Oct. 7, 2016)\n\nLilly Indus., Inc. v. Franchi, 3 A.3d 722, 727 (Del. Ch. 2010)\n\nS. Jersey Welding Supply, Inc. v. Permasteelisa N. Am., Corp., 2017 WL 1908904, at *4 (Del. Super. Ct. May 10, 2017) \n\nV. Statutory Protections\n\nDelaware has a robust legal framework for the protection of trade secrets. The state's Uniform Trade Secrets Act (UTSA), adopted in 1981, provides that trade secrets are property and are entitled to protection. 6 Del. C. \u00a7 2001 et seq. Specifically, the statute defines trade secrets as information, including a formula, pattern, compilation, program, device, method, technique, or process, that: (1) derives independent economic value, actual or potential, from not being generally known to or readily ascertainable by other persons who can obtain economic value from its disclosure or use; and (2) is the subject of reasonable efforts to maintain its secrecy. 6 Del. C. \u00a7 2001(4).\n\nUnder the Delaware UTSA, a person who misappropriates a trade secret is liable for damages caused by their misappropriation, including actual loss caused by the misappropriation and any unjust enrichment caused by the misappropriation that is not taken into account in computing actual loss. 6 Del. C. \u00a7 2004. Additionally, if the misappropriation is willful and malicious, the court may award exemplary damages in an amount not exceeding twice any award made under 6 Del. C. \u00a7 2004. 6 Del. C. \u00a7 2005. \n\nFurthermore, Delaware law provides for injunctive relief to prevent actual or threatened misappropriation of a trade secret. 6 Del. C. \u00a7 2002. This injunctive relief may be granted for appropriate periods of time and may be continued as long as the trade secret retains its confidential or secret status, and it is within the power of the court to include conditions that are reasonable necessary to protect the trade secret. 6 Del. C. \u00a7 2002. \n\nIn addition to protection under the UTSA, Delaware recognizes common law trade secret protection. In Sanders Assocs. v. Galen Capital Corp., 582 A.2d 215 (Del. Ch. 1990), the Delaware Chancery Court explained that trade secrets may be protected under both statutory and common law: \"The law of trade secrets is evolving, and the essential protections may come from (1) the statutory framework codifying certain elements of trade secret law and (2) the common law. Moreover, the distinction between 'statutory' and 'common law' remedies may be irrelevant for purposes of assessing damages.\" Id. at 226.\n\nIn summary, Delaware provides strong statutory and common law protection for trade secrets. Companies in Delaware have access to both injunctive and damages relief under the state's Uniform Trade Secrets Act, as well as protection under common law. As a result, businesses that rely on trade secrets as part of their competitive advantage should be sure to take appropriate steps to safeguard their confidential information. \n\nA. Delaware Uniform Trade Secrets Act\n\nDelaware is one of many states that have adopted the Uniform Trade Secrets Act (UTSA) to protect the rights of companies that possess valuable confidential information. The Delaware Uniform Trade Secrets Act (DUTSA) is codified in Title 6, Chapter 20 of the Delaware Code. The DUTSA defines a trade secret as any information, including a formula, pattern, compilation, program, device, method, technique, or process, that derives independent economic value, actual or potential, from not being generally known to or readily ascertainable through appropriate means by other persons who might obtain economic value from its disclosure or use.\n\nUnder the DUTSA, the owner of a trade secret has the exclusive right to maintain confidentiality and prevent its misappropriation by others. Misappropriation is defined as \"acquisition, disclosure, or use of a trade secret of another without express or implied consent by a person who knows or has reason to know that the trade secret was acquired by improper means or that the trade secret is a trade secret and that knowledge of the trade secret was acquired by accident or mistake.\" Del. Code Ann. tit. 6, \u00a7 2001.\n\nA trade secret owner may seek injunctive relief, damages for economic loss caused by the misappropriation, and in some cases, exemplary damages that could amount to twice the amount of damages awarded. Del. Code Ann. tit. 6, \u00a7 2005. The court may also award reasonable attorney's fees to the prevailing party if the claim of misappropriation is made in bad faith, or if willful and malicious misappropriation is proved by clear and convincing evidence. Del. Code Ann. tit. 6, \u00a7 2005.\n\nIn determining whether a particular piece of information is a trade secret under the DUTSA, courts consider a variety of factors. These factors include, among others, the extent to which the information is known outside the company, the measures taken to protect the secrecy of the information, the value of the information to the company and its competitors, and the amount of effort or money expended by the company in developing the information. See, e.g., CITGO Asphalt Ref. Co. v. Frescati Shipping Co., 756 F. Supp. 951, 962 (D. Del. 1991).\n\nIn Delaware, the DUTSA applies to both current and former employees of a company who have access to confidential information. In fact, the Delaware Supreme Court has held that an employee's duty of loyalty to his or her employer includes a duty not to disclose or use confidential business information acquired in the course of employment. See E.I. DuPont de Nemours & Co. v. Christopher, 431 A.2d 1012, 1019 (Del. 1981).\n\nIn conclusion, the DUTSA provides strong protections for trade secrets in Delaware. Companies can take comfort in knowing that they have legal recourse against those who misappropriate their confidential information, and that the courts take the issue of trade secret protection seriously. \n\nB. Civil Liability\n\nViolation of trade secret laws in Delaware can result in civil liability. An individual or entity that is found to have misappropriated a trade secret can be held liable for damages suffered by the owner of that trade secret as a result of the misappropriation. Under Delaware law, the owner of a misappropriated trade secret may be entitled to an injunction, damages for any losses suffered as a result of the misappropriation, and any additional damages that may result from the misappropriation (Delaware Code Annotated, Title 6, Chapter 20, Section 2008).\n\nIn order to establish a claim of misappropriation, the plaintiff must show that the information is a trade secret and that the defendant improperly acquired or used that information. The plaintiff must also demonstrate that the defendant had actual or constructive knowledge that the information was a trade secret at the time of the misappropriation. Additionally, the plaintiff must show that the defendant used or disclosed the trade secret in a manner that harmed the plaintiff (DuPont v. Kolon Indus., Inc., 771 F. Supp. 2d 773, 800 (E.D. Va. 2011)).\n\nImportantly, trade secret owners must take reasonable efforts to maintain the confidentiality of their trade secrets. Failure to take reasonable measures to maintain confidentiality may preclude a plaintiff from recovering damages for misappropriation of the trade secret (Delaware Code Annotated, Title 6, Chapter 20, Section 2002).\n\nIn addition to damages, a trade secret owner may also seek an injunction to prevent further use or disclosure of the trade secret. In order to obtain an injunction, the plaintiff must demonstrate that the defendant\u2019s actions are causing immediate and irreparable harm (Fresenius Kabi USA, LLC. V. Par Sterile Prods., LLC, 312 F.R.D. 213, 221 (D. Del. 2015)).\n\nOverall, trade secret misappropriation in Delaware can lead to significant civil liability, including damages and injunctive relief. Companies should take reasonable steps to protect their trade secrets and ensure that employees and contractors are aware of the company's policies and procedures for protecting confidential information. \n\nTrade Secrets in Delaware\n\nTrade secrets are considered confidential information which companies use for their competitive advantage. Delaware, like most states in the US, has provisions for protecting trade secrets through both statutory laws and common laws.\n\nThe Delaware Uniform Trade Secrets Act (DUTSA), which was enacted in 1988, defines a trade secret as any information that has economic value and is subject to reasonable efforts to maintain its secrecy. This could include formulas, designs, patterns, and any other types of information that can give businesses a competitive advantage. The Act also outlines the remedies available to companies in case of misappropriation of trade secrets.\n\nAccording to the DUTSA, a person who misappropriates trade secrets can be held liable for any damages caused to the owner of the trade secret. Misappropriation can occur through theft, bribery, or any other form of unauthorized disclosure or use of the trade secret. Additionally, the Act allows for injunctive relief to prevent further violations of the trade secret.\n\nDelaware has also recognized the common law protection of trade secrets. The state's courts have held that for information to qualify as a trade secret, it must be kept confidential and have a significant economic value to the owner. In Delaware, trade secrets can be protected by contract law, specifically through non-disclosure agreements or confidentiality agreements, which may specify the terms of disclosure and use of the trade secret. \n\nOne notable case on the protection of trade secrets in Delaware is FMC Corp. v. United States Steel Corp, 545 F. Supp. 666 (D. Del. 1982). Here, the court held that a former employee who misappropriated trade secrets could be held liable for the damages caused, including damages for future lost profits. \n\nIn conclusion, Delaware's laws on trade secrets offer companies substantial protection for their confidential information, which may include a wide range of information from designs to customer lists. Companies that wish to protect their trade secrets should ensure that they take reasonable measures to keep the information confidential, such as implementing non-disclosure agreements or other related contracts. \n\nSources: \n\n1. Delaware Uniform Trade Secrets Act, 6 Del. C. \u00a7 2001 et seq. \n\n2. FMC Corp. v. United States Steel Corp, 545 F. Supp. 666 (D. Del. 1982) \n\nVI. Remedies for Misappropriation\n\nWhen a trade secret is misappropriated, the owner of the trade secret is entitled to relief under the Delaware Uniform Trade Secret Act (\"DUTSA\"). Under DUTSA, the owner may seek both injunctive and monetary relief. \n\nA. Injunctive Relief\n\nUnder DUTSA, a court may grant an injunction to prevent actual or threatened misappropriation of a trade secret. DUTSA defines \"misappropriation\" as the acquisition, disclosure or use of a trade secret by improper means or without the owner's consent. 6 Del C \u00a72001(2). Thus, if the owner can demonstrate that a misuse of his or her trade secrets is either occurring or threatened, a court may enjoin the offending party from any further action involving the trade secrets, including from disclosing or using the information. \n\nIn fact, the Delaware courts have recognized that the injunctive remedy is the most important remedy for trade secret owners because of the difficulty in proving damages for misappropriation. See E.I. DuPont De Nemours and Co. v. Christopher, 431 A.2d 1234, 1242 (Del. 1981). Thus, in DuPont, the court affirmed the issuance of a preliminary injunction even though the plaintiff could not quantify the damages associated with the misappropriation at that stage in the proceedings.\n\nB. Monetary Relief\n \nUnder DUTSA, a trade secret owner may also recover damages for misappropriation. The statute provides three types of damages for a plaintiff who can prove misappropriation: (1) actual loss, (2) unjust enrichment, or (3) reasonable royalty. 6 Del C \u00a72005(a). \n\nActual Loss - To prove actual loss, the plaintiff must demonstrate the amount of loss actually suffered by the owner as a result of the misappropriation. This may include, for example, loss of profits or increased expenses. \n\nUnjust Enrichment - To prove unjust enrichment, the plaintiff must demonstrate that the defendant was unjustly enriched by the misappropriation of the trade secret. Proof of actual damages is not required for unjust enrichment; rather, the plaintiff must show only that the defendant received some benefit from the misappropriation.  \n\nReasonable Royalty - To prove a reasonable royalty, the plaintiff must demonstrate that the defendant would have agreed to pay a reasonable sum to use the trade secret. This sum must be reasonable in light of the surrounding circumstances, including the parties' relationship, the profitability of the defendant's enterprise, and the value of the trade secret. \n\nIn determining damages, the court may also take into account any unjustified expenses the owner incurred as a result of the misappropriation. Additionally, exemplary damages may be awarded if the misappropriation was willful and malicious. \n\nC. Preservation of Secrecy \n\nDUTSA also allows courts to order measures other than monetary damages and injunctive relief to preserve the secrecy of the trade secret. 6 Del C \u00a72004. Thus, a court can order the offending party to refrain from disclosing the trade secret or from using the trade secret for certain purposes. \n\nD. Criminal Penalties \n\nDUTSA also imposes criminal penalties for willful and malicious misappropriation of trade secrets. A person who is convicted of such an offense can be fined up to $10,000 for each violation. 6 Del C \u00a72006. \n\nE. Equitable Defenses \n\nIt is important to note that a defendant who has misappropriated a trade secret may not be completely liable under DUTSA. The statute provides for several equitable defenses, such as independent development and reverse engineering, which a defendant may raise to defeat liability. 6 Del C \u00a72004. \n\nIndependent development requires the defendant to demonstrate that the information used to create its product or service was developed independently, without the use of the plaintiff's trade secret. Reverse engineering, on the other hand, involves a process of disassembling or analyzing a product in order to determine its component parts and their functions. If the defendant can show that it developed its product through reverse engineering, and did not use the plaintiff's trade secret, then it will not be liable under DUTSA. \n\nF. Statute of Limitations \n\nFinally, it is important to note that DUTSA imposes a three-year statute of limitations for claims of misappropriation of trade secrets. 6 Del C \u00a72011. The statute of limitations begins to run when the misappropriation is discovered or should have been discovered with reasonable diligence. \n\nOverall, DUTSA provides a range of remedies for trade secret owners who have been victims of misappropriation. These remedies include both monetary and injunctive relief, as well as penalties designed to preserve the confidentiality of the trade secret. Defendants do have several equitable defenses at their disposal; however, the burden of persuasion is generally on the defendant to demonstrate that equitable defenses should apply. \n\nA. Injunctive Relief \n\nInjunctive relief is a powerful remedy that may be granted to protect trade secrets. Under Delaware law, a party seeking injunctive relief must demonstrate that: (1) it has a protectable trade secret; and (2) the defendant has misappropriated, or threatened to misappropriate, the trade secret. See Del. Code Ann. tit. 6, \u00a7 2009; Electro Scientific Indus., Inc. v. Gen. Scanning, Inc., 595 A.2d 1145, 1155 (Del. 1991).\n\nIf these requirements are met, a court may issue an injunction prohibiting the defendant from using or disclosing the trade secret. See Del. Code Ann. tit. 6, \u00a7 2009(b). Injunctive relief may also be granted to prevent a defendant from disclosing the trade secret to a third party. See id. \u00a7 2009(c).\n\nTo obtain an injunction, the plaintiff must establish that it will suffer irreparable harm if the injunction is not granted. See Dow Corning Corp. v. Masure, 444 A.2d 1030, 1036 (Del. 1982). Generally, the loss of a trade secret is considered irreparable harm because the damage cannot be fully compensated by money damages alone. See id.\n\nMoreover, injunctive relief may be granted even if the plaintiff has not suffered any actual harm. See Del. Code Ann. tit. 6, \u00a7 2009(d); Electro Scientific Indus., 595 A.2d at 1155. In such cases, the court may presume that the misappropriation of a trade secret will result in harm to the plaintiff. See id.\n\nInjunctive relief may also be granted to prevent the defendant from soliciting customers or employees of the plaintiff. See Del. Code Ann. tit. 6, \u00a7 2009(e). To obtain such relief, the plaintiff must establish that the defendant has acquired the trade secret through improper means, and that the defendant\u2019s use of the trade secret will inevitably result in the solicitation of the plaintiff\u2019s customers or employees. See Electro Scientific Indus., 595 A.2d at 1157.\n\nInjunctive relief in trade secret cases is generally considered to be an equitable remedy. See Dow Corning Corp., 444 A.2d at 1036; DuPont de Nemours Int\u2019l S.A. v. Kolon Indus., Inc., 801 F. Supp. 2d 622, 625 (D. Del. 2011). As such, the court may consider factors such as the balance of the hardships between the parties and the public interest in fashioning an appropriate injunction. See id.\n\nOverall, injunctive relief is a valuable tool for trade secret owners seeking to protect their valuable confidential information. Delaware courts are willing to grant injunctive relief in appropriate cases to prevent the misuse of trade secrets, and provide a powerful remedy to prevent their misappropriation.\n\nCitations:\n\n- Del.

Damages\n\nIn Delaware, the unauthorized use or disclosure of a trade secret gives rise to a cause of action for the trade secret owner to recover damages suffered as a result of the misappropriation. 6 Del. Cons. Stat. \u00a7 2004. \n\nWhen a trade secret is misappropriated, the trade secret owner may recover:\n\na) Actual damages: Actual damages are the damages suffered by the trade secret owner as a result of the misappropriation. For example, the trade secret owner may have lost profits, incurred expenses, or suffered damage to reputation as a result of the misappropriation.\n\nb) Unjust enrichment: The trade secret owner may recover the amount of unjust enrichment the defendant has gained as a result of the misappropriation. The trade secret owner may recover any profits the defendant made from the use or disclosure of the trade secret.\n\nc) Reasonable Royalties: If the trade secret owner can prove that the defendant would have entered into a licensing agreement for the trade secret, the trade secret owner may recover damages in the form of a reasonable royalty.\n\nIn addition to actual damages, the trade secret owner may also be entitled to punitive damages if the misappropriation was willful and malicious. 6 Del. Cons. Stat. \u00a7 2004(d). \n\nThe determination of damages in a trade secret misappropriation case can be complex and fact-specific. The trade secret owner must prove the amount of damages with reasonable certainty. See E.I. DuPont De Nemours & Co. v. Kolon Indus., Inc., 837 F.Supp.2d 423, 444 (D. Del. 2011) (citing Carvel Corp. v. Noonan, 350 A.2d 225, 228 (Del. Super. Ct. 1975)). The trade secret owner must show a causal link between the misappropriation and the damages suffered. See E.I. DuPont De Nemours & Co., 837 F.Supp.2d at 444-45.\n\nFurthermore, the trade secret owner must take reasonable steps to mitigate damages. See Cognitronics Corp. v. Deep Sea Elecs., Inc., 766 F.2d 46, 51 (3d Cir. 1985) (citing Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 774A cmt. b (1979)). Failure to mitigate damages may limit or preclude recovery. Id.\n\nIn sum, the trade secret owner may recover damages suffered as a result of the unauthorized use or disclosure of a trade secret. The trade secret owner may recover actual damages, unjust enrichment, or reasonable royalties. Punitive damages may be awarded if the misappropriation was willful and malicious. The determination and calculation of damages can be complex and fact-specific. \n\nExemptions to the Trade Secrets Law\n\nThere are certain circumstances in which the Trade Secrets Act may not apply. One such exception is the disclosure of trade secrets in the course of a government investigation or proceeding. Specifically, 6 Del. C. \u00a7 2004(b) provides that disclosure of a trade secret is not prohibited when made in connection with \"a court or administrative agency action or proceeding . . . for the purpose of enforcing or challenging the validity of a registered patent, registered trademark, or registered copyright.\" Additionally, a trade secret may be disclosed if the disclosure is required by law or a court order. Id. at \u00a7 2005(a)(1).\n\nAnother important exception arises when an employee's use or disclosure of a trade secret is made in a manner that is protected by the law of \"fair use.\" For example, an employee who discloses a trade secret in the course of a good faith report of illegal activity to his or her employer, to a government agency or to an attorney, is not prohibited under the Act, so long as the disclosure is made solely for the purpose of reporting the illegal activity. Id. at \u00a7 2004(c)(1).\n\nAdditionally, an employee may generally use his or her general knowledge, skills, and experience, even if that knowledge is related to the employer's trade secrets, provided that the employee does not use confidential information or trade secrets belonging to the employer. See Atofina Chems., Inc. v. Rhone-Poulenc Fiber & Resin Intermediates, S.A.S., 369 F. Supp. 2d 473, 501 (D. Del. 2005) (holding that an employee who had disclosed confidential information obtained in the course of his employment had not improperly disclosed trade secrets because he had relied solely on his general knowledge and experience in doing so); cf. FMC Corp. v. Fettis, 213 A.2d 351, 353 (Del. Super. Ct. 1965) (finding that an employee's use of confidential information not only violated the Trade Secrets Act, but also constituted a breach of the employee's duty of loyalty to the employer). \n\nVII. Conclusion\n\nIn conclusion, Delaware recognizes and enforces the legal protections afforded to trade secrets. The Uniform Trade Secrets Act, as adopted in Delaware, provides a framework for trade secret protection, and Delaware courts have consistently used this framework to decide cases involving trade secret misappropriation.  Under Delaware law, a trade secret is information that derives economic value from not being generally known or readily ascertainable by proper means, and the owner of such information can protect it from misappropriation by others.\n\nDelaware courts have applied a four-part test to determine whether the information in question qualifies as a trade secret, considering the extent to which: (1) the information is secret; (2) the owner of the information has taken reasonable steps to maintain its secrecy; (3) the information derives independent economic value from its secrecy; and (4) the information is the subject of efforts that are reasonable under the circumstances to maintain its secrecy.\n\nIn cases of trade secret misappropriation, Delaware courts have granted injunctive relief to prevent the use or disclosure of the trade secret, as well as monetary damages to compensate the plaintiff for any harm suffered as a result of the misappropriation. In some cases, courts have also awarded punitive damages to punish the defendant for their wrongful conduct.\n\nIt is important to note that the protections of the law apply only to information that truly qualifies as a trade secret, and not all confidential or proprietary information will necessarily qualify. It is also imperative to take reasonable steps to maintain the secrecy of trade secrets in order to protect them from misappropriation.\n\nIn summary, Delaware law provides strong protections for trade secrets and provides legal remedies to those whose trade secrets have been misappropriated. Businesses and individuals seeking to protect their confidential and proprietary information should consult with knowledgeable attorneys who can advise them on how to take appropriate measures to protect trade secrets under Delaware law.\n\nCitations:\n\nUniform Trade Secrets Act, 6 Del.

Summary of Delaware Law\n\nDelaware's Uniform Trade Secrets Act (\"DUTSA\") governs trade secret misappropriation claims in the state. Under DUTSA, a trade secret is defined as information that derives independent economic value from not being generally known to the public or to other persons who can obtain economic value from its disclosure or use, and is subject to reasonable efforts to maintain its secrecy. Del. Code Ann. tit. 6, \u00a7 2001(4).\n\nThe Act outlines three scenarios in which misappropriation can occur: (1) acquisition of a trade secret by improper means; (2) disclosure or use of a trade secret without consent; and (3) disclosure or use of a trade secret by someone who knows or has reason to know that their knowledge of the secret was acquired under circumstances that would make it improper. Del. Code Ann. tit. 6, \u00a7 2002.\n\nDelaware courts have applied the Restatement (First) of Torts in analyzing trade secret claims. See Elec. Data Sys. Corp. v. Steingold, 126 F. Supp. 2d 573, 579 (D. Del. 2001). A plaintiff must show (1) that the information sought to be protected was a trade secret, (2) that it was communicated to the defendant in confidence, and (3) that the defendant used it to the disadvantage of the plaintiff. C&D Techs., Inc. v. Boden, 372 A.2d 1218, 1222 (Del. Ch. 1976).\n\nDelaware courts generally follow a \"balancing approach\" when considering whether to enjoin a former employee from using or disclosing trade secret information. The court will weigh the employer's interest in preventing the use or disclosure of the trade secret against the former employee's interest in using their skills and knowledge to earn a living. See Jet Spray Cooler, Inc. v. Crampton, 361 A.2d 474, 477 (Del. Ch. 1976).\n\nDelaware courts also recognize the inevitable disclosure doctrine, which allows a court to enjoin a former employee from working for a competitor if their new position will inevitably lead them to use or disclose trade secret information. See Solomonic Pharm., Inc. v. Ferro Corp., 165 F. Supp. 2d 602, 603 (D. Del. 2001).\n\nOverall, Delaware law provides strong support for protecting trade secrets, but also acknowledges the need for balancing the interests of former employees who may possess knowledge and skills that are valuable to their future employers. \n\nB. Importance of Trade Secret Protection\n\nTrade secret protection is essential for businesses to safeguard their confidential information and prevent competitors from gaining an unfair advantage. The misappropriation of trade secrets can cause irreparable damage to businesses, including loss of market share, loss of revenue, and damage to the reputation and goodwill of the business. Thus, it is critical for businesses to take steps to protect their trade secrets.\n\nDelaware recognizes the importance of trade secret protection and provides comprehensive legal remedies to protect trade secrets under the Delaware Uniform Trade Secrets Act (DUTSA). As per \u00a7 2001 of DUTSA, \"a person is liable for misappropriation of a trade secret if the person\"(1) acquires the secret through improper means or (2) discloses or uses a trade secret without consent, and knew or had reason to know that the knowledge of the secret was acquired through improper means.\n\nUnder \u00a7 2004 of DUTSA, a court may issue an injunction to prevent actual or threatened misappropriation of trade secrets. Additionally, the court may award damages for the actual loss caused by misappropriation, as well as any unjust enrichment caused by the misappropriation.\n\nIn addition to DUTSA, Delaware has an established common law framework for trade secret protection. To establish a claim for misappropriation of trade secrets under common law, the plaintiff must show that they possessed a trade secret and that the defendant misappropriated that secret. Furthermore, the plaintiff must show that the defendant knew or should have known that the information was a trade secret.\n\nIn DuPont de Nemours, Inc. v. Christopher, the Delaware Supreme Court recognized the importance of trade secret protection and held that the company's \"proprietary information constitutes trade secrets, and failure to maintain them as secret is fatal to any claim for relief.\" 431 A.2d 1012, 1019 (Del. 1981). Similarly, in E.I. DuPont De Nemours v. American Potash & Chemical Corp., the court held that trade secrets were \"the vital ingredients of a competitive economy\" and that such secrets require the highest degree of legal protection. 123 A.2d 450, 454 (Del. Ch. 1956).\n\nIn conclusion, trade secret protection is crucial for businesses to protect their confidential information from competitors. Delaware's legal framework, including DUTSA and common law, offers comprehensive legal remedies for businesses to enforce trade secret protection. It is therefore essential for businesses to take proactive measures to safeguard their trade secrets and seek legal recourse if necessary."}

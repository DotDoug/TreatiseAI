In Delaware, the law recognizes trade secrets as a form of intellectual property and provides protection to businesses that hold confidential information. This article discusses the law of trade secrets in Delaware, including the definition of trade secrets, the types of information that can be protected, and the legal remedies available to businesses whose trade secrets have been misappropriated.\n\nDefinition of Trade Secrets in Delaware\n\nThe Delaware Uniform Trade Secrets Act (DUTSA) governs the protection of trade secrets in Delaware. Under DUTSA, a trade secret is defined as \u201cinformation, including a formula, pattern, compilation, program, device, method, technique, or process, that: \n\n(1) Derives independent economic value, actual or potential, from not being generally known to, and not being readily ascertainable by proper means by, other persons who can obtain economic value from its disclosure or use; and \n\n(2) Is the subject of efforts that are reasonable under the circumstances to maintain its secrecy.\u201d \n\n(Del. Code Ann. tit. 6, \u00a7 2001(4)).\n\nThus, in Delaware, for information to be protected as a trade secret, it must have both economic value and be subject to reasonable efforts to keep it confidential. The information must also not be generally known to the public or readily discoverable through legal means.\n\nTypes of Information that can be Protected as Trade Secrets in Delaware\n\nThe types of information that can be protected as trade secrets in Delaware are broad and can include a wide range of confidential business information. Some examples of trade secrets that may be protected in Delaware include:\n\n- Customer lists\n- Financial information\n- Marketing strategies\n- Research and development data\n- Unpatented inventions\n- Manufacturing processes\n- Technical drawings\n\nLegal Remedies for Trade Secret Misappropriation in Delaware\n\nIf a business believes that its trade secrets have been misappropriated, it can seek legal remedies under DUTSA. Misappropriation is broadly defined in Delaware as \u201c(i) Acquisition of a trade secret of another by a person who knows or has reason to know that the trade secret was acquired by improper means; or (ii) Disclosure or use of a trade secret of another without express or implied consent by a person who: \n\n(1) Used improper means to acquire knowledge of the trade secret; or \n\n(2) At the time of disclosure or use, knew or had reason to know that his knowledge of the trade secret was: \n\na. Derived from or through a person who had utilized improper means to acquire it;\n\nb. Acquired under circumstances giving rise to a duty to maintain its secrecy or limit its use; or \n\nc. Derived from or through a person who owed a duty to the person seeking relief to maintain its secrecy or limit its use; or \n\n(3) Before a material change of his position, knew or had reason to know that it was a trade secret and that knowledge of it had been acquired by accident or mistake.\u201d \n\n(Del. Code Ann. tit. 6, \u00a7 2002).\n\nIf misappropriation has occurred, the business may seek injunctive relief to prevent further disclosure or use of the trade secret. The business can also seek damages that result from the misappropriation, including any profits made by the person who misappropriated the trade secret.\n\nIn addition to seeking damages and injunctive relief, businesses can also seek to recover attorneys\u2019 fees and costs associated with bringing a lawsuit for trade secret misappropriation. \n\nConclusion\n\nTrade secrets are an important form of intellectual property that businesses use to protect confidential information. In Delaware, the law recognizes trade secrets and provides legal remedies to businesses that have had their trade secrets misappropriated. If a business believes that its trade secrets have been misappropriated, it should consult with an attorney familiar with trade secret law in Delaware to protect its interests."}
